# Motivation
When I was younger, I had a family member commit suicide. Since then I've always wondered what could impact someone to do that. I wanted to utilize this time to research the history of suicide to see I could find any correlations. I wanted to compare this data to social media and internet usage data I had. My reasoning for bringing that in, is I'm genuinely curious on if the internet and social media is having a negative impact on our mental health.

## Questions:
1) Does internet usage correlate with suicide over the entire world?
2) How does internet usage correlate with suicide in the United States?
3) What is the history of Suicide in the United States?
4) Are suicide rates across genders similar?
5) Are different age groups disproportionately affected by suicide?
6) After making this timeline do suicide rates correlate to the advent of social media?

## Limitations of the Data
I was able to find suicide date from 1900 to 2021. However my internet usage data was only from 1990 until 2021. This is still a good amount of data. 
The social media data I was able to find was even shorter. The social media data was limited as it is still a relatively new. The year ranges we as follows:
Facebook: 2008-2023 
TikTok: 2018-2023
Intstagram: 2013-2023
Youtube: 2010-2023
Since the last two years were not in my suicide data. I was unable to use these effectively.

Lastly my suicide data diving into the United States was just that, for the United States. I was unable to find social media data for just the United States. So my social media data is worldwide users. 

## Problems and Hurdles
Finding data that was not behind a pay wall was difficult. Also once the data was found some of it, was in pdf form. Converting that was a hurdle. Then finding intersecting data was also difficult. 

## Technologies Used
1) Python / Pandas - for exploration, normalizing and aggregation of the dataset
2) PowerBI - for creating interactive dashboard
3) PowerPoint - for introduction of Project
4) Git - for version control
5) Ilovepdf - to convert pdf to csv.

## Conclusion
The data analysis shows worldwide correlation growing between suicide and internet using percentage, although this correlation is not very strong. However the suicide data correlates strongly with social media usages accross the board. It is important to note that correlation does not equal causation. This data is also not perfect, as the users are worldwide and the suicide data is just for the United States. My key takeaway is that social media could be having a negative impact on our mental health. My thoughts as to why this may be? When people post on social media it is rarely something not positive. Mainly people post high lights of their lives. This can have a negative impact on ones mental health if they begin to compare their lives to the highlights of others. As we all no it is not always sunshine and rainbows.
